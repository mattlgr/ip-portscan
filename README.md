# ip-portscan

This script uses sockets to build a simple ipinformation response for the open ports of an ip.

here is an example of use:

```
device@device MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Reload/port scan
$ python main.py
Desired IP> ***.**.***.***
Response for ***.**.***.***
Port 21 (ftp) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 22 (ssh) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 23 (telnet) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 25 (smtp) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 53 (dns) open on ***.**.***.***!
Port 80 (http) open on ***.**.***.***!
Port 8080 (localhost) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 110 (pop3) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 143 (imap) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 443 (https) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 1433 (ms-sql-s) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 3306 (mysql) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
Port 5900 (vnc) is closed on ***.**.***.***!
```

Any suggestions for improvment are welcome, and I will take them into note, as this is soley for the purpose of me getting better at Python!
